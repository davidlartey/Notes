Happy New Year.

This blogging year hasn't started the way it could have been for me, so forgive the absence of new posts here so far. 

However, for my first blog post, I want to share a project I worked on during the holidays and have been yearning to share with you.

My younger sister loves to write, she wants to get better at it too and the only way to do that is to do the work. So I built her a website to share her writings (inspired by the mantra of gifts should always be physical possessions only, sometimes they should also be time spent doing something with them).

We called the project Imaginairing - creating words is an fun too. It means "the process of becoming someone extremely rich in imagination". Like billionairing - that isn't a word too - for one's imagination.

This is how the site works: a new short story is posted every other week. These stories can be read online, downloaded as an ebook or as an audiobook on soundcloud.

Here are the first three posts:
* Yova: The Innocent Sacrifice.
* Joycelyn's Choice
* The Shame

There is a newsletter, an RSS feed, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and SounCloud pages to update you when a new story is published. And also a contact page for your feedbacks.

I have enjoyed working on it and I hope you enjoy it enough that you share a word about us.
