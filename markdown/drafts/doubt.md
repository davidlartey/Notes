Take your mind a few years ago people believed that the earth was flat. That belief helped them stay together because everyone was scared of falling off the earth. But this belief wasn’t going to do so for ever. Fast forward a few more years and evidence became available that the earth wasn’t flat. But people still held on to their old beliefs. And the ones that dared to accept this new knowledge had to pay dearly. Why?
Because, they didn’t have DOUBTS.
Doubt is what makes you think out of the box. It delivers you from ignorance. It gives us breathtaking inventions. In fact, without it there’ll be nothing new because we’d be too satisfied with the old.
Fast forward another few years to the turn of the century and this time everyone believed we’ve reached the end in what phones would be able to do. Well that was also true until Steve Jobs doubted it all and we know how it went. You might actually be reading this on a smart phone because he doubted that knowledge.
Even in Jesus’ time, the difference between those that were impacted by His message and those usually referred to as ‘teachers of the law’ who weren’t was doubt. One group doubted what they knew - if they even knew - while the other always judged His message in the light of what they knew. And again we know now that went too.
In what way can doubt make your work better?
