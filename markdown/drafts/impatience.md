#Impatience: Because sometimes it's what you need.

Boy and girl in a relationship, boy promises to marry girl before traveling to a far away land, after sometime boy is still not back so girl gets into another relationship. Boy returns and marries another girl, takes his new bride to the land-of-milk-and-honey.
The default reaction from everyone is: girl has lost what was her's because of impatience.
But what if he wasn't hers in the first place? What if they weren't meant to be together? What if the milk and honey in that far away land is worse that what is in her land? What if her new guy is the one she's been waiting for all her life?
It might actually be that she's lost what was her's but it might also be she's gained what was her's by being impatient.
Sometimes being impatience work for our good just as patience does. We only need wisdom to know when we ought to be <link>patient with ourselves</link> and when we don't.
Have you ever felt you needed to be impatient?
