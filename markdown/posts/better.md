ï»¿I had a conversation with a friend about the rest rooms. He made a comment along the line of: "I don't ever use the school's rest rooms because I don't know who used it last and how he left it."

**But what if everyone who uses the rest room leaves them better than when they came in? How pleasant and healthy would it be?**
**What if I leave every room I enter better than when I came in?**
**What if I leave the life of every person I meet better than the when I met them?**
**...**

**What if we left things, people, places better than the way they were when they came into our lives?**
