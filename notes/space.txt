#Space

Unlike most people, I experienced a lot of space during the holidays. This holiday was my first since I decided to become a minimalist and I think that decision played a role in creating the amount of space I enjoyed. Now I'm back to my 17-hour day and looking back I'm discovering the reasons why I truly needed the space that I enjoyed.
1. The distractions this world is offering is on an all time high and the - unfortunate - news is that it is never going to become fewer. Just consider the number of programs available to you on TV today compared to the same time last year.
