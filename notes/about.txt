Hi, I'm David Lartey.
I was born in 1991
I'm from Prampram, Ghana, but spent the first three-quarters of my life in Bonny, Nigeria.
I believe in God and I'm learning to live like Jesus Christ.
I am a minimalist at heart.
I like creating things with code, occasionally with words: this blog, Soundcloud.
I read, listen to new songs, watch Arsenal and daydream.
Thanks.

Colophon
