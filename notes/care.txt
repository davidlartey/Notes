Forgive and Care

“...never forgive yourself, for not caring or not trying.”
~ Seth Godin

The older I get, the more responsible I become and the more I realise I'm limited and have weaknesses too. My response so far has been to avoid these as much as I can and pray that God helps me care less about them.
However, reading this, has given me a different way of thinking about imperfections. One that calls for forgiveness - forgiving myself. One that calls for caring instead of just turning a blind eye.
Caring, because:  
It shows you are not ignorant about your life.
It shows you want better.
It leads you to find grace. 
It makes you appreciate the healing process better.
...
I choose to care about my limitations and I also choose to forgive myself for having them.
Forgive yourself for being imperfect but don’t forgive yourself for not caring about that imperfection!
