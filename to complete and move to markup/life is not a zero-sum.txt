A few weeks ago I watched an interview Mark Zuckerberg gave at a conference and something stood out for me. He said he believes Facebook is not in a “zero-sum” system. Whats a zero-sum system? Its a system where everything must always add up to zero. An increase in one side must result in or be a result of a decrease on the other side of the system. For example, in a company with a fixed number of employees, for someone to get a promotion, some other person needs to be demoted or worse still, fired. So what he was saying is that for Facebook to ‘succeed’ other companies don’t have to fail.
But life does not obey the rules of this kind of system. That I am sure of, not only because he said so but because it clearly true. You might say the example I gave above happens several times in life. Yes, in life people get fired and people get employed but when someone gets fired they sometimes end up finding better jobs openings that weren’t results of some other person being fired.
And I think the people and businesses that are managed with this mentality that life is not a “zero-sum” system are the ones that end up as successful.
Ok with all the blurs, all I’m trying to say is that no one has to fall for you to stand, no one has to fail for you to succeed. And you don’t have to fall for someone to stand, you don’t have to fail for someone to succeed. So live your life, do what you have to do and leave the rest to God.
