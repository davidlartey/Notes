Some time ago I had this conversation with a close friend of mine and like friends do we were talking about everything that came up. And suddenly we found ourselves talking about the rest rooms in our school.
This friend of mine then made a comment that went something like this: “I don’t ever try to to use the rest rooms because I don’t know who used it last and how he used it.”
Weeks latter, I’ve not forgotten that statement and I’m finding myself asking myself the question of: “if everyone who ever used the public rest room at school would leave them better than they saw it. How fun it would be for everyone to use them.”
But for me the lesson is not in what others do.
For me the lesson is: “what if I leave every room I enter better than I saw it when I came in?” What if I left the rest room, my office, my church, my school, etc better than when I came in.
And it can go wider than that. Up to: what if I leave every life better than the way they were when I first met them? What if someone would thank God in heaven because he or she met someone called David Lartey? What if, what if, what if? So many what ifs that I can’t share here because of space and time.
But what if we left things, people, places better than we they came into our lives?
