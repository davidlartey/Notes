#Define

At the barber shop today I heard something like this: "God is the only Christian.".
And I just found myself asking how does the speaker define Christianity. I don't know how he defines it but I guess it'll be something similar to Perfection. Or Sacrificial Giving.
Two things that struck me:
1. His definition is wrong.
2. His perspective most likely have been shaped by the behaviour of another 'Christian' born out of the definition of christianity to that Christian.
How ever we define our faith shapes how we live and that shapes what people see and that shapes what how the define our faith.
However, if knowing God is the perfect one should lead you to define your God as someone through whom you are made perfect. And not be scared away because of it.
