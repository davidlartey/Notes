#Venture: Because Vision is not Enough!

"Vision is not enough; it must be combined with venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps; we must step up the stairs." - Vaclav Havel
I came across this quote over the weekend as I was (reading: link to reading list) Getting Things Done by David Allen so I took some time to think about it.
Venturing adds life to a vision. It stops a vision from being only a wish. It makes the vision reality.
To venture means to do something that brings you closer to that place your vision has shown you. It isn't always the biggest of actions you take but its mostly that small act you overlook.
Venturing means giving a smile because you are looking forward to a world filled with love; fixing a neighbour's computer because you want to help the world through technology; not replacing those clothes because you want to be a minimalist or even arranging the contents of your drawer at work because you want to be more organized.
In everything you do today or tomorrow or the next, make sure you do something that is a step towards your vision. Give because love is not enough; work because faith is not enough and venture because vision is not enough.
