Adaptation. It’s what keeps cockroaches alive while marmots have been long gone. It’s the difference between healthy innovative companies and the rest. It’s the reason why we’ve enjoy inventions like fire, clothes, computers, phones and all the others.
I believe that at some point in every life, we all encounter situations that demands us to adapt. Whether we like it or not. Life happens and after happening, demands us to adapt to what just happened.
Fortunately, I’m currently going through such a situation. And I’m beginning to discover ways in which I can adapt to my situation in order to what I have set before myself. Over the next few weeks and months, I would have to loosen my hold on some of my beliefs, I would have to work MORE, play and rest less.
But another thing I’m learning also is that, true adaptation knows when to return back to old ways.
Currently, for me, there is the challenge of adapting to this new work schedule I have, but I’m expecting a even greater challenge in returning to how I use to live before, after I’ve fully adapted myself to this. And my success there would play a huge role in me becoming who I want to be in the long term.
And I think its the same for everyone and everything in life. To fulfil one's purpose, you have to learn to adapt to change in any direction of your life. Forwards or backwards.

Edit: “To succeed” to “To fulfil one's purpose”
